BUILD-ANDROID-ISOLATED.SH - SCRIPT DOC
=====================================

FILE: build-android-isolated.sh
LAST UPDATED: 2025-10-30 (NDK timeout/logging; removed worklets force-install)

OVERVIEW
--------
Creates a temp isolated env, installs deps, and builds APK & AAB locally.

CHANGES
-------
- Prefer existing NDK at $ANDROID_HOME/ndk/26.1.10909125 and skip install if present
- sdkmanager install now prints progress and uses optional timeout via $SDKMANAGER_TIMEOUT (default 900s)
- If 'timeout' binary is unavailable, proceeds without timeout (with visible logs)
- Removed force-install of react-native-worklets to avoid expo-doctor mismatch
- Exports ANDROID_NDK_HOME and ANDROID_NDK only if the NDK path exists
- Sanitizes temporary eas.json to remove any hardcoded ANDROID_NDK* env keys before building

USAGE
-----
/Users/divakarchoudhary/Downloads/enout-main/build-android-isolated.sh

NOTES
-----
Ensures minSdkVersion 24 (via app.json plugin) and stable NDK to avoid CMake hermestooling errors.
If builds previously appeared to hang at "Ensuring Android NDK...", this update surfaces sdkmanager logs and caps install duration to avoid silent stalls.
